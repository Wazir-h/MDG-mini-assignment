This is my mini MDG project for password generator. To access this CLI you need to open the folder containing 
the exe file at terminal and type

./pswdgen


command to see the prompt.


The commands for the CLI:

gen :  This command will generate password and store it in a binary non-readable format. The hashed value
     along with date and time of generation will be stored in a text file.
     
     You should always state a unique purpose of each of your password as it will be the key to access
     your password in case you forget.
     
     
acs: This command will show your password stored in .dat file. To access password enter your purpose 
    along with command.

desc: Shows the entire binary file.
